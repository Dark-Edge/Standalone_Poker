##Standalone Poker Script.

play Poker on your server

##PURPOSE :

This script is a free standalone poker game that you can trigger with the /startpoker command.
As for now it only include few tweaks as it take me at least 48 real hours to script that

the code is entirely made by myself so it’s standalone but it’s possible to add some framework to work with.

There is no rules implemented yet so it’s only for RolePlay but i’m gonna add it soon

##INSTALLATION :

Add “ensure Standalone_Poker” in your server.cfg

##IN GAME :

you can use admin console commands “/startpoker” to start a game.

it includes buttons to call / raise or fold or leave the game.
It’s an early script and i can’t test it multiplayer but it’s scripted to sync UI to all current players.
